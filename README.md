# PRODIGY_CS_01
This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple substitution cipher used for encrypting and decrypting text. The program allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption

## Usage:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the script using Python 3:
 python caesar_cipher.py
Follow the prompts:
Enter your message.
Provide a positive shift value for encryption or a negative shift value for decryption.
Choose the mode (‘encrypt’ or ‘decrypt’).

### Example
Suppose you want to encrypt the message “HELLO, WORLD!” with a shift value of 3. Here’s how you would use the program:

Enter your message: HELLO, WORLD!
Enter the shift value (positive for encryption, negative for decryption): 3
Choose mode ('encrypt' or 'decrypt'): encrypt
Result: KHOOR, ZRUOG!

#### Notes
The Caesar Cipher is not suitable for serious security purposes, as it is relatively easy to break.
Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged during encryption/decryption.
Enjoy experimenting with this historical encryption technique!
